              <h4>My Story</h4>
              <p>
                My journey all started in the summer of 2017 when I thought I had a great app idea. Instead of doing more research and trying to build the app myself I hired a team to build the vision I had in mind. I'veÂ learned so much during the process! I came to find out that I really enjoyed the tech industr and knew this is what I wanted to do the rest of my life so I started teaching myself to code. I assumed this would be my best route since it would give me a better understanding of how things worked or just a better understanding of what my team was working on. It would also hopefully give me an opportunity to work on my app someday instead of paying someone. Over the years my passion and desire to learn more about this industry has grown dramatically. I've come to love coding and all the amazing things you can do with it.

              <h4>What I enjoy</h4>
              <p> I've loved the woods since I was little. I grew up playing in the woods with my brothers and that hasnt changed much. I love hicking, camping, mountain biking and traveling. Since moving to Florida, I've started free diving, fishing, and sky diving. I also turn my hobby of photography and videography into a small business.</p>
